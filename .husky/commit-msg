# What It Does:

# When It Runs: This script executes after you write a commit message but before the commit is finalized.
# Purpose: It typically checks that your commit message follows certain guidelines or a specific format (like using conventional commits). If the commit message doesn't meet the criteria, it will prevent the commit. This helps maintain a clean, understandable commit history.
