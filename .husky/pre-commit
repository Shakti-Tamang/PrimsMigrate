# What It Does:

# When It Runs: This script runs automatically every time you attempt to make a commit.
# Purpose: It checks your code for any formatting or syntax errors by running a linter
#  (like ESLint or Prettier). If the linter finds errors, it will prevent the commit from proceeding. 
#  This ensures that all code committed to the repository meets the code style and quality standards set 
#  by your project.



#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

# Run lint-staged if you have it set up
npx lint-staged

# Or, run your linter or formatter directly
# npx eslint . --fix
# npx prettier --write .
